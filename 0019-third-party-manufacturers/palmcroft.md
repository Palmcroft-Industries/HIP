## Budget and Capital
Palmcroft industries has ample capital to bring 10,000 units to our future customers by Q1 2022.

## Risks and Challenges
- By using custom chips and technology we circumvent the issues around shortage of supplies in
the supply chain but raw material prices will affect us more greatly.
- Because the technology being used to support this network is well known and often used for other
purposes it was a challenge to communicate with our designers about exactly what we needed,
once we hurdled this it has been smooth sailing.
